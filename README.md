# Zomato Sales Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Zomato’s global restaurant data
to uncover insights related to restaurant distribution, cuisine
popularity, pricing trends, customer ratings, and online delivery
availability.

The dataset was cleaned and processed using Python libraries such
as Pandas and NumPy, and the final insights were presented through
an interactive Power BI dashboard for easy exploration.
## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to help stakeholders,
restaurant owners, and analysts understand:

- Which countries and cities have the highest number of restaurants
- The most popular cuisines, especially in India
- Value-for-money cities based on cost and ratings
- Online delivery trends across regions
- High-performing localities for restaurant expansion
## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualization
- Excel / CSV – Dataset handling
- GitHub – Version control and documentation
## Dashboard Explanation

### Summary KPIs
The dashboard starts with KPI cards displaying total restaurants,
cities, cuisines, countries, and average cost for two. These KPIs
provide a quick overview of the dataset scale.

### Cuisine Analysis
A bar chart highlights the most popular cuisines in India, where
North Indian cuisine dominates, followed by Cafe, Chinese, and
Fast Food.

### Country & City Analysis
Donut charts show restaurant distribution by country and city,
revealing that India and metro cities like New Delhi have the
highest concentration of restaurants.

### Brand & Rating Analysis
A combined chart compares cuisine count and aggregate ratings
for major restaurant chains, helping evaluate brand performance.

### Locality Analysis
A bar chart ranks localities by restaurant count, identifying
high-density food hubs with strong business potential.
## Key Insights
